Metabolic Engineering in the field of Synthetic Biology has 
the potential to manufacture products at scale using cell 
factories via precision fermentation techniques. This model
uses thermodynamically constrained kinetic data to converge
towards the solution space utilizing Gaussian Process Regressors.


This repository are some first pass tests as an ML researcher
applying basic ML packages on synthetic biology data.

For general ideas and study purposes

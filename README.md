Metabolic Engineering in the field of Synthetic Biology has 
the potential to manufacture products at scale using cell 
factories via precision fermentation techniques. This model
uses thermodynamically constrained kinetic data to converge
towards the solution space utilizing Gaussian Process Regressors.

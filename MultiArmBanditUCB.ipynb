    "UCB Algorithm: The core of the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) is that for each arm, we compute a confidence bound on its mean based on how many times it has been selected. The algorithm then selects the arm with the highest upper bound, balancing the exploration of arms with fewer pulls (higher uncertainty) and exploiting arms that are known to give high rewards.\n",
